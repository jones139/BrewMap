      <h2>OSM Brew Map Tag Queries</h2>
      <p>This page identifies entries in the OSM database that <em>might</em>
	be breweries, distilleries or wineries based on the name tag, or if 
	they are tagged as vineyards.   There are quite a few exceptions
	to try to avoid false positivies (like parks called 'Brewer Fields').
        The query that produces this page can be seen at 
        <a href=../server/BrewMap.cfg>BrewMap.cfg</a> if you are interested 
        in suggesting improvements!</p>
      <p>
	Please use the 'browse' links to check if these should be tagged as
	industry=brewery or craft=brewery, then edit them.   The data for the
	page is updated every 10 minutes so you can check back a bit later to
	make sure your updated entries have disappeared from here and appeared
	on the main BrewMap map.
      </p>

      <p>Note that the edit links do not work at the moment. I do not know why
	- they use the same syntax as you get on the OSM 'browse' page for
	the element.</p>
